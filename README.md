# nilearn_task_networks
Building a pipeline and tutorial for task fMRI analysis from nistats to nilearn 

## Data description
Run 1 of Human Connectome Project N-back task fMRI data (N = 33)

## N-back task description
Within each run, the 4 different image types are presented in separate blocks within the run. Within each run, ½ of the blocks use a 2-back working memory task (respond ‘target’ whenever the current stimulus is the same as the one two back) and ½ use a 0-back working memory task (a target cue is presented at the start of each block (Barch et al., 2013; NeuroImage).
